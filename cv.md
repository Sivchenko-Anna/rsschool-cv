## About Myself
I started getting acquainted with the IT sphere, *when I was sure that "1000%" programming was not for me.* However, it turned out to be incredibly interesting, albeit not an easy task!

At first, I learned the basics of Python, then I took courses in html and css. Gradually began to learn Javascript. The constant search for quality sources of information and opportunities for self-study brought me to the RS School!

In the future, I hope to become a professional Frontend developer, who works on interesting projects and makes this world a better place.

```javascript
function testMath(a, b, c) {
    let S = 1/2*a*b*Math.sin(c*Math.PI/180)
    return S
}
